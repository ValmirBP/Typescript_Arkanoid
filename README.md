## GameMechanics

- Ball Movement: The ball moves continuously and bounces off the paddle, bricks, and walls.
- Brick Collision: The ball breaks bricks upon collision. The game tracks remaining bricks and updates the score.
- Paddle Movement: The paddle is controlled by the player to keep the ball in play.
- Win Condition: The game is won when all bricks are broken.
- Game Over: The game ends when the ball falls below the paddle.
